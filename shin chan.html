<p>Shinchan Nohara is a five-year-old kid from Japan. He is very mischievous.Always be happy and keep smiling no matter what the situation is. Happiness is always the key.It undoubtedly was an anime for kids, but it might have some difficulty passing through in today's heavily policed climate. Similar to many American cartoons and other TV shows, the anime Crayon Shin Chan was a children's series with very questionable humor, but this particular aspect is what makes it so memorable.</p>
<b>Crayon Shin-chan is the episodic adventures of a little boy in contemporary Japan, and his eventful life in his nuclear family. It first started out as a manga in 1990 and was animated two years later, and is still ongoing. It‚Äôs safe to say that the latter adaptation is best known, which birthed memes and gifs one after the other. The illustration is simple, colorful, and light-hearted, yet the script, though equally as entertaining, was a little too mature, if not completely inappropriate. </b>

<h2>International releases :</h2>
<p>The series was first dubbed into English by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California through 2001‚Äì2002, when TV Asahi and Lacey Entertainment decided to market the series worldwide. During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the United Kingdom, on Fox Kids in Australia, on Channel i in Singapore and on RT√â Two in the Republic of Ireland. Subtitled versions also aired on St√∂d 2 in Iceland and on Arutz HaYeladim in Israel. RT√â Two has not shown the series since 2005, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, as a slot-filler. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, Pat Fraley, Eric Loomis and Anndi McAfee playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.[32]

    In 2003, Phuuz entertainment inc. was commissioned by Lacey Entertainment to continue in similar style as the Vitello dub. But their episodes featured a new cast of voice artists (among others Diane Michelle, Julie Maddalena, Peter Doyle).
    
    52 episodes have been produced of the Vitello dub and 52 episodes of the Phuuz dub. Vitello and Phuuz episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. Some of the dubs of the series used the Vitello dub as the source for the dubbing. Some dubs also dubbed the Phuuz dub afterwards.
    
    Funimation acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006.[33] As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.</p>
